The Tours and Travel Management System is a web-based application. The main purpose of the “Tours and Travels Management System" is to provide a convenient way for a customer to book hotels, trains, and buses for tour purposes. In this project, we will make the task of searching for places easier by booking a train or bus. In the present system, a customer has to approach various agencies to find details about places and book tickets. The project ‘Tours and Travels Management System’ is developed to replace the currently existing physical system and also helps in keeping records of every customer activity.
